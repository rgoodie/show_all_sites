# show_all_sites
Produces a block that shows all sites in a Drupal 7 multisite install. If you've named folders properly and they match the URL patterns you entered into the admin page, you'll get a nicely formatted list. 

# To begin
- Install the module
- Configure a list of your domain names (admin/config/show_all_sites)
- Place and configure the block where you want it

# Notes
You may want to limit the block only to administrators or trusted users.
